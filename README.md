# logoglyph v0.1

## A Lua script to produce semirandom simple geometric patterns.

Mostly written for the sake of having a project on which to learn Lua, though I intend to integrate it into a web-app (rank pictures to determine the best parameters, eventually I plan to feed a set judged as "good" into a machine-learning system and see what happens) when I have time.

**WARNING:** Very rough, does not yet have error-checking. Providing invalid command-line arguments thus generally results in a crash.
